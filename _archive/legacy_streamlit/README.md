Reason: Repository refocused as EcgPlanet.com Newsletter infrastructure (static + email). These files implemented prototype transactional / UI experiments not aligned with the newsletter mandate.
Next Steps If Needed:
- Transactional logic should be refactored into: expert-system (decision flows) or EmpireOsKernel (OS-level services).
- If resurrecting any workflow, create a mapping doc: expert-system/streamlit-mapping.md
Checksums (refer to git history for original versions):
- app.py
- test_app.py
- minimal.py
- new_app.py
- simple_test.py
- virtual_silk_road_landing.py
